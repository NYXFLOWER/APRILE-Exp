`APRILE-Exp` is the explainer of [`APRILE`](https://github.com/NYXFLOWER/APRILE). It is designed to explain predictions made by [`APRILE-Pred`](https://github.com/NYXFLOWER/APRILE-Pred). 

This is the repository for reproducing results on `APRILE-Exp` in the paper "APRILE: Exploring the Molecular Mechanisms of Drug Side Effects with Explainable Graph Neural Networks". [[paper]]()

Previously, we provide a command line tool for the APRILE-Exp, called `PosePath`. Now, we do not develop it anymore, but it is still available at the PosePath branch. 

If you are interested in using `APRILE`, we recommend installing this easy-to-use implementation following the instructions [[here]](https://github.com/NYXFLOWER/APRILE).
